# Customer-and-Sales-Analysis-with-Tableau-
In this project, I have curated 2 informative fully automated and functional dashboards, namely 'Sales' and 'Customer'. The Dashboards are curated by carefully analysing and understanding the User Story prepared by discussing the needs imposed by stakeholders.
Upon making this project, I learned and excelled in working with Tableau. Also, the important KPIs required to analyse customer behaviors and sales trends.  
NOTE : This is a personal project focussed to enhance and hone my skills. The Dataset used is obtained via Kaggle.
